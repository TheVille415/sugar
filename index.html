        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Sugar and I'm a cute white dog! I'm a nine-year-old Maltese and I love to play with my toys and go on walks with my owner Jordan. My favorite treats are bacon jerky and carrots. </p>
		<p>As stated before Sugar is a Maltese purebred, who is very affectionate, and loves to eat things she shouldn’t. These things consist of pizza, chips, napkins, and her daughter's food. She is born in California and raised in San Francisco. She loves to go on walks by the beach and when she can will zoom through the grass!</p>
		<h2>A day in the life</h2>
		<p>A day in the life of Sugar consists of waking up at 9 AM. Then she is going outside to use the restroom. From there we feed her and let her roam around the house. By the time everyone has gone to work so we leave her with my grandmother once people start coming home Sharron comes back down to our house and gives everyone their daily amount of kisses.</p>
